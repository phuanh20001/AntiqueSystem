# Sample Hardhat 3 Beta Project (`mocha` and `ethers`)

This project showcases a Hardhat 3 Beta project using `mocha` for tests and the `ethers` library for Ethereum interactions.

## Project Overview

This example project includes:

- A simple Hardhat configuration file.
- Foundry-compatible Solidity unit tests.
- TypeScript integration tests using `mocha` and ethers.js
- Examples demonstrating how to connect to different types of networks, including locally simulating OP mainnet.

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run all the tests in the project, execute the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

You can also selectively run the Solidity or `mocha` tests:

```shell
npx hardhat test solidity
npx hardhat test mocha
```

### Make a deployment to Sepolia

This backend now uses a CommonJS Hardhat setup.

To compile the contracts:

```shell
npm run compile
```

To deploy `AntiqueVerification` to Sepolia, make sure `.env` contains `ALCHEMY_SEPOLIA_URL` and `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`, then run:

```shell
npm run deploy:antique
```

After deployment, copy the printed contract address into `.env` as `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.
